          What's a Pikachu?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Pikachu is an electric type pokemon that resembles a mouse with a squirrel's tail. Pikachu is sometimes unpredictable and without proper insulation, you may experience electric shock. Pikachu may be tiny but overcomes any obstacle that comes in his/her way, ideally, you would not want to evolve a pikachu because Raichu (Pikachu's evolved form) is not so cute.

          Why Pikachu is the best?
        </h1>
          <p>
            Pikachu has gone through some tough times. When Mewtwo kidnapped humans and pokemon alike, his owner sacrificed himself to save his owner. That's some serious deep stuff right there. Pikachu has shown time and time again how much of a loyal companion he/she is, Pikachu is also a master of impersonating other pokemon and has no problem making friends.
